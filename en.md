## Lidimist Manifesto
### Version: 1.2.0 - Last updated on 3/25/2024

1. Art will always be a child of its time, a child that will always be born - regardless of the wishes of the time - and that can take any form and any medium, from traditional brushes and chisels to the digital waves of the modern era. A daughter who carries in her entrails the unmistakable mark of her time of origin, acting as a complex mirror that reflects the vicissitudes, hopes and neuroses of the era that saw her born. But this chameleon-like nature of art, although it is the source of its richness and vitality, carries with it a mortal risk: the risk of being co-opted, diluted and ultimately domesticated by the predatory forces of commercialization and superficial entertainment. So, without the right education, it could be lost in time, swallowed up by some social network - or advertising project - and expelled back in the form of cheap, mind-fragmenting entertainment. Reinforcing entertainment, in its simplistic essence; a digital narcotic that alienates minds and, by extension, societies, fulfilling the function of a cultural anesthetic that lulls the public into a complacent lethargy, while the mechanisms of power - always eager to control and consume - sneak forward, like water that silently seeps into every pore of the skin.  
2. History is full of examples where art has served as a bastion against oppression, a cry of resistance that resonates through the centuries. Think of Picasso's “Guernica”, a powerful testimony against the horrors of the Spanish civil war, or Tarsila do Amaral's works, which capture the essence of a Brazilian cultural identity, fighting against the tide of cultural homogenization. These examples illustrate the transcendental capacity of art to rise above mere entertainment, becoming an instrument of social criticism, a weapon in the fight against the destructive forces of conformism and consumerism.  
3. If art is to continue to fulfill this vital role, there must be a radical re-evaluation of the way it is perceived and valued in contemporary society. We need to change the way we teach art, teaching techniques and methods. We need to respect art as a form of expression that makes us question, challenge and change. Only then can we expect art to maintain its position as a force of resistance against mass culture and consumerism, serving as a beacon of hope and humanity in an increasingly broken and sick world.  
4. In this dark digital age, we are witnesses and victims of a nefarious alchemy that shapes the fabric of reality as it pleases. Digital alchemists skillfully and maliciously weave disinformation, spreading it across social networks like a voracious plague that devastates fields already weakened by neglect and manipulation. Their disciples, both accomplices and innocent propagators of this plague, carry the poison forward, ensuring that no corner, however protected it may seem, remains untouched by this infestation that shapes perceptions and, in turn, the future; it's like a pandemic.  
5. This coordinated attack on the truth has devastating consequences: it paves the way for authoritarian regimes, exacerbates environmental and socio-economic crises, and concentrates power and wealth in the hands of a few individuals and corporations, perpetuating inequalities and injustices. In this dystopian scenario, reality is no more than a fabricated illusion, a mirage created to entertain, distract and dominate.  
6. Some people react to anesthesia before being overwhelmed by apathy, but not everyone is like that, not everyone is present in the present and attentive to their surroundings in the same way as we are on our violent streets. Faced with this incessant assault on reality, a collective depression emerges, a despair that permeates the souls of those trapped in the machinery of this system. Each day becomes a blurred reflection of the previous one, a cycle of automatism where life is lived without presence, without depth, a mere existence without truly living. The originality of being is sucked away, leaving behind only an avatar, a shell of existence that follows predetermined routines until death. There are more and more useless distractions and the desire to produce - for the wrong reasons - grows along with a lack of collaborative vision with the rest of society. This is the first depression.  
7. Then comes the adoption of fabricated truths, choosing to live in an alternative reality, far from factual truth and authenticity. People - already doomed to implicit slavery in their daily routines in search of income - choose their muse; a justifying and calming being for the Kafkaesque life they have come to live, a god, or gods, who can be the target of requests for healing and salvation that take responsibility for what has happened away from them. The negationist and ignorant spectacle then grows. On this stage, individuals reject science, embrace conspiracy theories and pseudo-knowledge, exchanging intellectual integrity for illusory comforts. Bertrand Russell, decades ago, warned of the danger of believing in something not because it is true, but because it is convenient. The price of this betrayal of one's own essence is the loss of freedom, the ability to question and actively participate in building a better future. This is the second depression.  
8. To break these chains of manipulation, a collective reaffirmation of truth, reason and skepticism is crucial. We need to recognize and resist the digital alchemy that threatens our perception of reality, seeking authenticity and responsibility in the way we live and interact with the world around us. Only then can we aspire to a more just, equitable and truly free society. Otherwise, what are the sacrifices in the name of a blindfold that we tie over our own eyes?  
9. For a long time now, rational morality has been systematically challenged by religious institutions and extremist movements. In the current context, this clash has reached a dangerous peak, where the distance to a point of no return seems to be shortening. We observe a society that, in a desperate attempt to assert its individuality, opts for willful blindness, embracing alternative truths to the detriment of proven historical and scientific facts. Everything that contradicts their personal folk beliefs is abandoned. They think they can do without blindfolds, but they tear out their own eyes and scream for attention; for their own truths; oblivious to the steps they take. This abandonment of reason turns human expression into a mere futile shadow, relegating the arts - which should act as mirrors and critics of society - to superficial and sterile roles.  
10. In this frantic search for instant gratification, pleasure and wealth, perpetrated under the complacent gaze of behavioral reinforcers, human existence degrades into a constant struggle against apathy, a battle that many already seem to have lost. The environment doesn't allow for easy changes and life passes as quickly as you want happiness to arrive. The human spirit, in its most apathetic state, is nothing more than a zombie in the relentless march of state capitalism, making up the “third depression”. Art, in this scenario, loses its purpose and becomes an empty commodity, a game of financial speculation far removed from its true communicative role. A product distributed by the hundreds around the world, in reproductions sold on the web by pseudo-famous people or exhibited in millionaires' galleries, always with the sole aim of making a profit; leaving the important role of communicating the incommunicable relegated to some other plane in the work of artists who don't achieve prominence.  
11. Faced with this desolate landscape, art faces the challenge of resisting the pressure of selfishness, bad taste and devaluation imposed by the contemporary era; a world inhabited by ignorance and its depressions. Artists, although displaced in this theater of the absurd, must not give in to the forces that demand their submission. However, the dilemma persists: the need for survival often forces creativity to bend to alienating work, consuming the space needed for free expression. Now, depressions are the fruit of the state itself, a way for capitalism to maintain itself in these final periods of life.  
12. Technology, paradoxically, offers an opportunity for artists to transcend these limitations, allowing them to take their “galleries” directly to the public. However, this same technology also uncovers deep flaws in our social evolution. Under the sway of social media, the quest for intellectual progress is often replaced by an unbridled race towards fame and superficial recognition. This system values empty numbers - engagement, followers, views - to the detriment of quality and originality. Art thus risks being reduced to mere repetitions of past aesthetics, in a vain attempt to capture recognition that was valid in other historical and cultural contexts. Artists find themselves trapped in a desperate imitation of the techniques, materials and ideas of the great masters, hoping to be recognized as authorities in a field increasingly saturated with aesthetic apathy. They sell themselves in a disturbed surrender to aesthetics validated in the past, with the aim of gaining similar recognition in times other than the one we live in now. And they say that digital art isn't real art? They nurture the desire to feel like, for example, a Renaissance master, an expressionist or an academic of yesteryear, just to show off supposed skills and authority using bases that are already known and easily accessible. Artists who feel out of place should not surrender to the will of those who want them to, no matter how difficult the task may be. The artist shouldn't have to sell the space of his creativity within his daily thoughts to work that only serves the purpose of basic well-being, of survival; work carried out in an almost irrational way. The artist needs this space for themselves, they need to have this choice as a real alternative and, if they don't have it, that they can have a tool to communicate these ideas in the least expected ways and obtain their survival resources in the same way.  
13. This crisis in art reflects a broader crisis in society - a struggle against the forces of dehumanization brought on by late capitalism, which feeds on our collective inability to imagine and fight for a world where art and human expression can flourish freely. Resistance to this trend must begin with a profound reassessment of the values that underpin our society and a renewed commitment to art as a vital means of critique, communication and, above all, as an act of resistance against the sterilization of human experience.  
14. Art, as a sign of profound communication, must react, it must accompany the progress of the ages, it must surpass it and, when that age lets itself be held back, it must pull it, provoke it. Revolutionary historical figures like Lenin understood the importance of a structuring theory to catalyze radical change. This theory must be an instrument of universal communication, capable of crossing the barriers that separate an academic locked away in an art university from a daily worker struggling to survive.  
15. Based on this premise, I propose an analysis that transcends the visible, entering the realms of the invisible through skeptical reflection, without having to abandon, as Clive Bell defined as a significant form, beauty or ugliness. Through this introspection, it is possible to achieve an analytical and inferential art that encapsulates both common experience and the artist's unique visions. This movement distances itself from both realism, which limits itself to the tangible, and surrealism, which loses itself in the abstraction of the subconscious, seeking a new form of expression that encompasses the complexity of human experience and makes the current generation run away from reflections necessary for its own survival. As well as the survival of creatures who cannot make their own choices.  
16. Art communicates - even in the spotlight with the weakness of commercial art - and when we talk about communication, about language, we are talking about the mediator between reality and our mind; reality only exists in us through language. Translations will always be versions of the original, they will never express precisely the same thing and its small nuances. Concepts are lost and sensations no longer find form in our inner voice in the absence of the ideal language. Our homeland is our language, said Fernando Pessoa. We inhabit our language and, through art, we can share a homeland with the world, a common language, a common culture, which has already begun with the advent of the internet. Lidimist Art aspires to be that universal language that John Dewey envisioned, resisting triviality and seeking a deeper meaning.  Lidimist Art, therefore, is not content with the superficial representation of the natural world; it aims to reveal what lies beyond the obvious, using metaphor to unveil deeper truths. This movement recognizes the limitation of our senses and the inherent complexity of reality, drawing inspiration from the philosophy of Pyrrhus of Elis to express an understanding of reality that goes beyond the surface, without falling into the trap of dogmatism or emotional judgment. It is foolish to leave this language abandoned to futility without value and reason.  
17. In line with what we all believe, the name given to the new mode of expression available is LIDIMISM, a word that must be understood in a particular way. It is defined as:  
18. LIDIMISM. n. 1 - Skepticism in search of an understanding of the truth, whereby reality is expressed musically, in writing, through paintings, tattoos - and any other creative means - sharing space with inferences analyzed by the artist; 2 - Applied to things we can see and those we can only imagine and express in an allegorical way; 3 - The expression of an understanding in an almost symbolic character; exposing a surrealized reality in all its symbolic depth; 4 - A timeless artistic-analytical movement, with aesthetic similarities to other movements, such as Naturalist, Surrealist, Minimalist and Expressionist.  
19. Art is a philosophy that helps us understand human experience through its representation. The natural world is outdated for the arts; it can still be captured by paintings, music or precisely by photographs, but it says little about what is shown, it goes into little depth without the help of more tools. Art that emerges from a tired perspective can be as emotive as a closed book cover. The authentic natural world is implied in our time and perhaps will continue to be so in the future. It can't just be seen from what the eye can see at first. It needs the reading of this hypothetical book, it is dynamic. The Lidimist movement portrays what its etymology, from lídimo, teaches us: what is accepted as legitimate, true, authentic, genuine in all its representations. And for this, the gaze must be on what we see beyond the superficiality of what our own eyes show us of the world, even if this representation requires unrealities that explain the real in a metaphorical way; the eyes of the mind must be used more than the eyes of the face. Like Pyrrhus of Elis, we need to know that, in the world of appearances, it is impossible to obtain sure knowledge directly from reality, from absolute nature, which is undeniably incomprehensible to human beings. We must therefore express ourselves - even if it is not possible to know how things really are - without judgment, rationally, without being carried away by emotions and personal desires. After a deep analysis of what we infer and feel about them, express how things appear to us in all their completeness, beyond the reality that we can see. We can symbolize vision and reasoning, but we must do so with the ordinary person in mind, the worker, who is the master of the analysis of this art and must be able to understand it at least at the initial level of interest. This is Lidimism, alongside people's imagination and emotions, inviting them to use both. Lidimism is an invitation to reflection and imagination, a call for each individual to explore the depths of their own perception and experience. This movement is not just a new art form, but a new way of seeing and understanding the world, an attempt to capture authenticity and truth in all its forms. It is a manifesto against superficiality, a battle cry for depth of thought and expression, a call to look beyond the obvious and find beauty and meaning in the hidden layers of existence.  
20. Skepticism and rationality, often misinterpreted as inhibitors of creativity, are in fact essential catalysts for genuinely profound and free artistic expression. They provide fertile ground where interpretation and expression not only coexist, but flourish together, bridging the gap between the complex and the comprehensible with singular elegance. Far from being obstacles, they are the keys that unlock new realms of thought and perception.  
21. In art, aesthetics is not a limit, but a portal for communicating ideas that reside beyond the reach of the ordinary. Light and shadow, for example, transcend the mere function of embellishing or illustrating a theme; they become living entities, capable of invoking realities beyond our everyday existence. Art, in this sense, becomes a vehicle for exploring not only what is, but what can be, employing the mundane world as a source of inspiration for extraordinary revelations while still expressing concepts of form.  
22. The things seen may not be possible to represent in the form of ordinary reality, because that is what ordinary reality is. In art, ordinary reality itself is read by the artist in search of information, from the past and future times of the chosen theme, to be expressed in language, in extraordinary reality, expressed in a less obvious way, in an aesthetically unreal way, stimulating thought that was previously forgotten or left in the background. Once again, the eyes of the rational mind are used more than the eyes for the supposedly real world of fabricated truths.  
23. Even so, as photographs they express the psychology of the gaze and, by absorbing light, replace the need for realism in paintings. Lidimism appropriates the bizarre, the real, reimagining them in new forms that resonate with deeper meanings. This approach does not seek merely to decorate or entertain; every aesthetic choice is deliberate, intended to communicate, to provoke reflection. The lidimist acts as a shrewd interpreter rather than a translator, revealing layers of meaning that may go unnoticed by the inattentive observer.  
24. In this age of technological dazzle, humanity is distracted by the illusion of being the central axis of existence, neglecting the truth of its cosmic insignificance. Art manages to challenge this notion, to expose the superficiality of the automatism that permeates both contemporary thought and action. Lidimism's critique extends to inflated literary production and commercialized music, both symptoms of an era obsessed with ephemeral content devoid of substance. In a world saturated with dispensable information, Lidimism takes a stand against triviality, promoting an art that seeks transcendence and purpose.  
25. The value of a text lies not in its length, but in the relevance and depth of its content. Writers who inflate their works with empty words perpetuate the cycle of distraction and disengagement. In the same way, music, this universal form of expression, must not surrender to the clutches of capitalism, which prioritizes the production of disposable works aimed at passive consumption and quick profit. Lidimism rejects such impoverished artistic expressions, aspiring to an art that enriches, challenges and elevates the human spirit.  
26. Therefore, Lidimism is not just an artistic movement; it is a call to reconnect with the authentic, a manifesto against mediocrity and complacency. It invites us to explore the vast territory of the possible, to rethink our relationship with art, culture and society. At a time of superficiality and dispersion, Lidimism stands as a beacon of depth, meaning and intellectual resistance.  
27. The aim of Lidimism, when reflecting on the fabric of contemporary art, requires a deep understanding of its predecessors and the currents that have shaped the art scene so far. In Realism, we see the naked representation of human interaction with its social environment, a search for the unadorned truth, the critical analysis of the bourgeois condition. Naturalism, in turn, intensifies this vision, exposing in an even more raw and visceral way human nature as a direct product of its environment, plunging into the depths of reality to excavate the underlying layers of rot.  
28. Still in the 20th century, Surrealism emerged, with its focus on the subconscious and the oneiric, proposing a radical departure, materializing scenes that defy ordinary logic, creating an anarchic universe of infinite possibilities. In this panorama, Lidimism emerges as an evolutionary link, synthesizing the rawness of Naturalism with Surrealist freedom, recognizing the individual not only as a product of their social environment, but also as a being reconfigured by the State, algorithms and media manipulation. Lidimism, therefore, aims to express a social reality whose subjectivity demands an expanded aesthetic, a reality that transcends mere observation to embrace extrapolation, movement, sonority and intensity. Lidimism is the next step, like a Naturalist-Surrealist child, because man is still a product of the social environment, but a product created in a more intense way, manipulated by the state and by algorithms on social networks and search engines. The subjectivity of social reality calls for a more unreal aesthetic to be represented in a truly realistic way - beyond the word. The new reality is not just in the eyes and is definitely not true in the depths of subconscious thoughts; it is extrapolation, movement, sound and fury, everything that makes it non-empty of reason to exist. Even if the artist chooses not to reveal his reasons, preferring to leave it up to the audience to put the puzzle together; this is because he knows that revelation would still leave room for analysis - understanding the art would be like understanding someone other than the artist - the art would still be accessible initially with all these considerations.  
29. This movement is not content with revealing its intentions openly; it prefers to involve the audience in an active process of discovery, aware that even the most complete revelation will leave room for interpretation. How, after all, can we condense the complexity of a human being and their experiences into simple language, without resorting to the aid of unrealities that help us understand the implicit?  
30. Lidimism rejects the superficial imitation of modernity, crammed with fleeting and empty stimuli, and strives to communicate profound ideas through expressions that transcend the ordinary. In this quest, the movement flirts with the conception of multiple realities encapsulated in singular instants, where abstract concepts such as time and anguish materialize in allegories. Reminiscent of medieval aesthetics, but infused with the vitality of Latin American fantastic realism, where the unreal is something not only possible, but everyday, commonplace. Lidimista art is therefore inherently fantastic, even in its most minimalist manifestations, always seeking to expand the space for multiple interpretations.  
31. In this post-truth era, where the linearity of the world has been definitively unmasked as an illusion, perspective in Lidimist art is freed from any convention: it can be distorted, inverted, atonal, spherical, non-Euclidean. This art seeks not only to express, but to explore, to delve into the depths of human experience and extract from it a meaning that resonates with the complexity of our current existence. Lidimist Art, therefore, takes on the role of filling in the gaps left by incomplete reality, using logic, reason and ethics to illuminate the shadows of the human condition, so that it serves not just art for art's sake, but a wider social purpose. It must not be obvious, because more than expression, art must also be exploration and this is the hallmark of Lidimist Art.  
32. It aims to show the dimension of everyday issues through both natural and mental lenses, just as science aims to show the dimension of our planet from an outside perspective - an effort to fully understand our existence, which would be impossible if we only looked at it from the point of view of our own surface. I reiterate: reality today is incomplete; it is up to art to use logic, reason and ethics to fill in these gaps and serve a larger, social spectrum. Art must show the dimension of everyday issues from the perspective of nature and the mind, just as science must show the dimension of our planet from outside of it, otherwise we would never have a full understanding of it, living on its surface and looking at its walls.  
33. Science and technology, when used in a humanitarian spirit, are powerful forces that promote progress and understanding. However, in the grip of despots, they become instruments of oppression, tearing apart the veil of privacy and subjugating lives to authoritarian control. Cryptography, smart contracts and other emerging innovations then become vital tools in safeguarding the integrity and authenticity of artistic expression. They allow us to protect art from the clutches of censorship and ensure that the critical messages it carries survive attempts at suppression.  
34. Ensuring the authenticity of your work and collaborating with the logical analysis of experts in the future is important. The importance of art transcends the aesthetic; it is a testament to the time of its creation, a reflection of the hands and minds that gave it life. Protecting art means protecting the ongoing dialog between the present and the future, ensuring that future generations have access to our era, with all its complexities and contradictions. Lidimist art can lead us to a future in which it is possible to experience the full spectrum of humanity.  
35. This manifesto, although rooted in its own time, aspires to a timeless existence. It is a call for art to transform and adapt, resisting and defying the relentless flow of time. It should be a living, evolving document, a compendium of art's struggles and triumphs against adversity. A reminder of the power of art in times of difficulty. This manifesto is timeless as long as we live in a world of insanities, as long as we live in times of normalized and forgotten abuses - I'm referring to humanitarian abuses and those related to animal rights - and as long as there are people interested in something better than this destroyed world, with humility towards reason.  We find ourselves in an era where insanity is routine, where the normalization and forgetting of abuses - whether against humans or animals - are hallmarks of our society. This Manifesto is a cry for a future where rationality, critical analysis and a deep humanism guide our path towards a fuller spectrum of human experience.  
36. Lidimist art must not be confined to the walls of galleries, but spread out into the streets, accessible to everyone, especially working people. It must be a celebration of life in all its forms - love, fear, anger, hatred - and become the universal language through which we explain the intricate, the complex. Let it capture love, fear, anger, hatred; let it be popular.  
37. I dream of the day when this text will be seen only as an echo from the distant past, a reminder of a time when the fight against ignorance and superficiality still had to exist. May it serve as a reminder of our efforts to transcend mediocrity and celebrate the depth and richness of human experience. May we, in the future, look back at the Lidimist comrades who came before us - those who infused the movement with their art, those who gave art to the movement, for we are as one. - and proudly proclaim: “We did it”. May this manifesto inspire not just reflection, but action towards a world where art, in its purest and most revolutionary form, serves as the beacon that guides us out of the shadows of ignorance and conformity.
